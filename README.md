aciPlugin - A little jQuery plugin helper

aciPlugin can help you write extendable jQuery plugins. You can override a
parent method, call the super method or other parent methods and keep
instance based data. The extension to a plugin can have its own default options
that will be added to the extended ones. aciPlugin has built in functionality
to get/set plugin options and check the 'init' state (useful for stateful
plugins).

See the demo for a simple plugin implementation.
