aciPlugin - A jQuery plugin boilerplate

aciPlugin can help you write extendable jQuery plugins. You can override a
parent method, call the super method or other parent methods and keep
instance and private data. The extension to a plugin can have its own
default options that will be added to the extended ones. aciPlugin has built
in functionality to get/set plugin options and check the 'init' state (useful
for stateful plugins).

See the demo for a basic plugin implementation.
